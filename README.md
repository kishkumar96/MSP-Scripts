**Description of the Geomorphic and Bioregional Assessment Script**

---

#### **Overview**

This script performs a comprehensive assessment of **geomorphic features** and **bioregions** within defined fishing zones using spatial analysis techniques. By analyzing the spatial overlap between fishing zones, geomorphic features, and bioregions, the script quantifies how these physical and biological marine features intersect with areas of fishing activity. The outputs include detailed statistical summaries, visualizations, and reports that aid in marine spatial planning, conservation efforts, and understanding of marine ecosystems.

#### **Key Objectives**

- **Spatial Intersection Analysis**: Determine the areas where fishing zones overlap with geomorphic features and bioregions.
- **Quantitative Assessment**: Calculate the total area and percentage of each geomorphic feature and bioregion within each fishing zone.
- **Reporting**: Generate summary reports in CSV and PDF formats, including statistical tables and visualizations.
- **Visualization**: Create bar charts to illustrate the distribution and occupancy percentages of geomorphic features and bioregions within fishing zones.
- **Validation**: Ensure accuracy through systematic data validation procedures.

#### **Data Inputs**

1. **Fishing Zones Layer** (`Zones_Palau.shp`):
   - Contains geographical boundaries of fishing zones.
   - Reprojected to EPSG:3857 for consistent spatial analysis.

2. **Geomorphic Feature Layers and Bioregions**:
   - **Geomorphic Features**:
     - **Abyssal Classification**: Classified deep-sea areas based on depth and terrain.
     - **Basins**: Depressions or low areas on the seafloor.
     - **Bridges**: Underwater ridges connecting elevated areas.
     - **Canyons**: Deep valleys or gorges on the seabed.
     - **Escarpments**: Steep slopes or cliffs under the ocean.
     - **Ridges**: Elevated regions or mountain ranges under the sea.
     - **Shelf Classification**: Different areas of the continental shelf with specific characteristics.
     - **Slopes**: Areas where the seabed descends from the continental shelf to the deep ocean.
     - **Trenches**: Deep, narrow depressions in the ocean floor.
     - **Hadal Zones**: The deepest parts of the ocean, typically in trenches.
     - **Rift Valleys**: Large depressions formed by tectonic activity.
     - **Seamounts**: Underwater mountains formed by volcanic activity.
     - **Spreading Ridges**: Areas where tectonic plates are moving apart.
   - **Bioregions**:
     - **Bioregions Layer**: Represents regions defined by distinct biological and ecological characteristics.

   - Each layer may have a **category column** (e.g., `Class`, `Type`, `Draft name`) for further classification.

#### **Functional Steps**

1. **Initialization**:
   - Import essential Python libraries: GeoPandas, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy, ReportLab, etc.
   - Configure logging to track progress and capture errors.

2. **Data Loading and Preparation**:
   - Load the fishing zones layer and reproject it to EPSG:3857.
   - Define the paths to geomorphic feature layers and the bioregions layer, including their category columns.

3. **Iterative Analysis for Each Fishing Zone**:
   - Loop through each unique fishing zone.
   - For each zone:
     - Extract zone geometry.
     - Calculate the total area of the zone in square kilometers.

4. **Processing Geomorphic Features and Bioregions**:
   - For each layer (both geomorphic features and bioregions):
     - Load and reproject the layer to match the fishing zones' CRS.
     - Perform spatial intersection with the current fishing zone.
     - Calculate the area of intersected features within the zone.
     - Save the intersected layer for validation and future use.

5. **Statistical Summaries**:
   - **Overall Statistics**:
     - Total area of each layer.
     - Area within the fishing zone.
     - Percentage of the layer within the zone.
     - Percentage of the fishing zone occupied by the layer.
   - **Category-Specific Statistics** (if applicable):
     - Perform similar calculations for each category within the layer.

6. **Visualization**:
   - Generate bar charts to visualize:
     - Percentage distribution of categories within the fishing zone.
     - Percentage of the fishing zone occupied by each category.
   - Save charts as PNG images for inclusion in reports.

7. **Report Generation**:
   - Create DataFrames for overall and category-specific statistics.
   - Save summaries as CSV files.
   - Generate a comprehensive PDF report using ReportLab:
     - Include title, tables, and embedded visualizations.
     - Ensure tables are well-formatted for readability.

8. **Data Validation**:
   - Compare calculated areas from intersected layers with summary data.
   - Log discrepancies to assist with troubleshooting and ensure data integrity.
